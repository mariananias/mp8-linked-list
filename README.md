Q&A: How using a dummy node (and circular linking) simplified the code? What are the benefits?

    Using a dummy node simplifies handling edge cases and improves readability. Besides that, 
    circular linking eliminates the need to check for the end of the data structure. We can
    definitely see improvement of the code.
